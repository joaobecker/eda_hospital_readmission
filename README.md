# Hospital Readmission Data Analysis

##### This project will evaluate the preliminary report used by the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reduce excessive readmission rate.


### Results - 
##### The preliminary report does have a statistical significant findings. However, the recommendations are not very sound as the proposed project is not practical significant and the data could have been shown in a better way. 


##### We strongly reject Carl's hypothesis that the mean of a healthy human body temperature is 98.6, and we have a 95% confidence that the true mean lies between 98.12 - 98.37 degrees Fahrenheit.
